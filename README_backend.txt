I suggest using IntelliJ SpringBoot and Maven integration to run this project. The backend was done using the Ultimate Edition of IntelliJ, but Visual Studio Code with the proper JDK and extensions works as well.

Next Steps:
Integrate Database
Establish interactive features and proper redirection as the controller of the project
